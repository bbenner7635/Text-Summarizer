Currently, I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at University of California, Berkeley excited at the prospect of working with SpaceX as a Software Engineer after graduating in May 2023. As a student completing a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, I have challenged myself by taking multiple years of demanding computer science, electrical engineering, and mathematics courses in my area of study, including Databases, Operating Systems, Machine Structures, Data Structures, Computer Programs, Designing Information Devices and Systems I & II, and Calculus in addition to having extensive experience with Unix systems and front-end and back-end development in Python, Java, C, JavaScript, SQL, HTML, and CSS.

I am also a motivated and diligent person who can work both by myself and with others. Challenges motivate me to become more hard-working and encourage me to explore new things in the realm of technology. I would love the opportunity to further discuss with you the contributions I can make to SpaceX as a Software Engineer and am available to interview at your convenience. Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions using my contact information.
